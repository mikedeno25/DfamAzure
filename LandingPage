<p2>  Today's world is coneected in ways that I could have never imagined when growing up in what I believed was the small town of Henderson Ky. I remember paying by the minute to use a pay phone. Then, fast forward ten years suddenly we were paying by the minute to use the internet. Ten more years and suddenly we were paying by the minute to use the tiny touchscreen computers in our hands which were quickly evolving into powerhouses. Yet another ten years later there is a touch screen phone in the hands of 81% of Americans, 2.5 televisions in everyhome, and even most of them are smarter than their owner on a bad day. Cars really do drive themselves, at least sometimes.</p1>
<p3>  Let's face it with all the technology built into all that is around us it is easy to find yourselve overwhelmed with seemingly simple tasks that may no longer be as simple thanks to tech being so deeply engrained in our society. I for one, wish I had someone walk me through my first android phone setup when i switched from a flip phone. I have spent my entire life, being "the guy" that all his friends call to figure out the latest gadget, or get the most rescently outdated ones back up and running again. I started as a young child helping mom and dad with the vcr then the early game systems as the came out. I will never forget the 13 taps and 3 blows it used to take to get that super mario brothers 3 cartridge moving again each night.
<p4>  Nothing could quite hold my intest though like what was to come. The tech boom of early 90's saw rise to the desktop computer becoming a staple in a growing number of homes. I remember being 9 years old when the librarian in our school came and asked me to help her set up the schools new windows computer system.  It took us nearly 2 days to install that first windoiws 3.1.1. I was never more thrilled to watch a screen do so little. Whiile New technology can be exciting like that, for others it can bring anxiety undue stress and even fear.
<p5>  Of course, that's where e come in. With a wide array of support service options we strive to serve everyone from the individual who just got a shiney new thing and needs help to the company that is struggling to keep up in todays tech-revolution.
